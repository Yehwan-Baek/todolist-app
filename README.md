3. Task List Retrieval: Users can retrieve their current task list through the API. The API offers filtering and sorting capabilities, enabling users to tailor their task views based on various criteria.

4. Session-Based User Authentication: Users log in through the API, and authentication is maintained through sessions. This ensures secure access to their task lists.

5. Error Handling and Status Codes: The API validates requests, providing appropriate status codes and error messages for robust communication with clients.

6. Security Features: User passwords are securely stored using bcrypt, and the API maintains security through authenticated sessions.

7. This To-Do List API prioritizes user-friendly and secure task management, leveraging the powerful features and flexibility of Express.js.
